This was a fun platformer that I made. While the physics seem kind of strange and the graphics are an assortment of colored rectangles, they have been made like that to give you a feeling of freedom. Use the arrow keys to move around. The different colors of rectangles represent different things: the red is you, the orange in normal ground (you can go horizontally but not vertically through it), the yellow kills you, and you must touch the blue to get to the next stage. I am making a sequel of this called the Xenon lab (Xenon is by far the most awesome noble gas, right?).
