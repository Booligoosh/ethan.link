This is an early release for a simulated operating system: Lithium OS. Some apps are not yet finished. Also, I know it is very pixelated, but I am working on making it vector. The username is your Scratch username (if you don't have one or are not logged in, just use the username 'guest'). The password is 12345 (great password, right?). FUN FACT: The element lithium has an atomic weight of just 6.94. In comparison, the element bismuth has an atomic weight of 208.98!
