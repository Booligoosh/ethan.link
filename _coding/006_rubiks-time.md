This is a clean, flat design Rubik's cube timer I made. I made it because I got fed up with the ugly/cluttered look of other timers. I also made it so I could include unique features, such as a line graph of all solves over time. It took a long time to make, and is definitely the hardest and most complicated thing I have done. The mobile version is not completely working yet. I have started work on a [multiplayer version][rubiks-time-multi], where you can time people simultaneously and see the winner.
