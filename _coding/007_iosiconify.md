This is a service I made for adding websites to the home screen on Apple devices. When websites don't specify an icon and you add them to the home screen you get an ugly and badly sized screenshot. But not anymore! With iOS iConify, simply specify an icon image and voil√† - your home screen doesn't look ugly anymore. I made this using Javascript. I had to make a script which took all the variable parameters from a url. I thought I would share it with the public so if you want to utilise it in your projects you can [here][urlParams]. At the moment I am working on letting the user upload images as well as image liks.
