This was a website that I made for a friend's company. I had to design the entire website, and then code it. I also designed the logo. One big challenge that I faced was having to make the "Our content" carousel. I'd never done this before, but managed to code one from scratch using mainly CSS and barely any JavaScript. Another challenge was finding a creative way to show and hide the video. I decided to make it so that when you click the button, the title slides up to reveal the video under the form. Another thing that took a while to work out were the cool horizontally scrolling backgrounds.
