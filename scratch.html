  <h4>This is when I decided to try my hand at cloud data. In Scratch, cloud variables can only be numbers. This meant I had to convert letters into number and vice versa.

This version can have as meany characters as you want, and uses lists and custom block to make the process more efficient. Press space to change the message. This is not a chat.
