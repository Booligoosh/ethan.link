Maybe I'm biased, but I just love using 1Feed.

Today I've heard the first [update][bluesky] on Twitter's decentralisation project in over a year (which I have [opinions][bluesky-response] on btw), seen that Signal has just finished working on [version 5.3.0][signal-update] which brings chat wallpaper support and profile "about" sections, and received a daily update from my state's health department confirming that we've had [zero][nsw-health] new locally acquired COVID cases for the 5th day in a row.

I probably wouldn't have known about any of these things for at least a few days, or possibly even not at all, if I wasn't using 1Feed.

And yet, my information diet feels so much calmer than before I started using 1Feed. I spend so much less time scrolling through endless information than I did before.

Because 1Feed lets me keep up with the most _valuable_ content.

Almost in real time. Without wearing me out.

It's amazing what you can achieve when your daily content consumption isn't guided by an algorithm from an ad company :)

P.S. here's a [link to 1Feed][1feed] if you want to try it out.
