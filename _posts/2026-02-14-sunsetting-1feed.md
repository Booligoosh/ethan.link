After over 5 years, 1Feed will be shutting down on 15th May, 2026.

I unfortunately don't have the time to continue maintaining it, and with dwindling usage, I'd prefer to shut it down properly rather than leave it in a state which disappoints users who sign up hoping for a great experience.

This post will outline what you should know as a 1Feed user today, as well as what is next for the project (hint: I'll be releasing the source code).

## What's happening to the 1Feed accounts/brand/domain?

First up, for full transparency &mdash; I've found another maker who is interested in using the 1Feed *brand* going forward. This means that there will be a new product called 1Feed, under the same domain and accounts.

While this does mean that the "old" 1Feed will no longer exist, it also means that **no data or information about 1Feed users is being sold to anyone**, which was very important for me as part of this deal. I know that you all have trusted me with your information and I wanted to make sure that I held up my end of the promise.


## I'm a 1Feed user: How does this affect me?

**You will no longer be able to sign into 1Feed from 15 May, 2026.** This means that you will have to migrate to another feed reader or other method of subscribing to your topics of interest by that date.

**The 1feed.app homepage may also disappear/change prior to the sunset date**, so to continue using 1Feed, please bookmark the link to the actual app: [https://my.1feed.app](https://my.1feed.app).

**I am happy to provide you with an export of your subscriptions in JSON or OPML format.** Please send an email to [1feed@ethan.link](mailto:1feed@ethan.link) from the email you signed up with and what format you would like (there's few enough users that it's quicker for me to do it this way than build a self-serve exporter). Please note that only the content sources that use RSS will be able to be imported into another feed reader.


## I'm paying for 1Feed Premium, what will happen?

I have not charged any customers since January. All current 1Feed Premium customers will be able to use Premium for free up until the sunset date. All customers on yearly subscriptions currently expire prior to the sunset date.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:1feed@ethan.link) if you have any further questions!

## Quick list: Alternatives to 1Feed

Here are some options you can consider, straight from the old 1Feed homepage!

- [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at/) is good for desktop users who like a more dense view and a more unique vibe (and is what initially inspired the project)
- [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/) is good for users who prefer static ‘digests’ rather than a feed they can dip into at any time
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is a more ‘classic’ RSS reader that shows you a feed of posts rather than a feed of people/sites


## Releasing the 1Feed source code

I do think 1Feed was a great product, and throughout the years I got various requests to open-source 1Feed. Now that I'm shutting it down, I figure why not open-source it in case someone in the community would like to make something out of it or continue running it under a new name!

What this will look like:

- This will just be a "dump" of the source code &mdash; I won't be actively maintaining it, accepting pull requests, etc.
- If you would like to run it as an open-source project and be in charge of maintaining it, you are welcome to do so (in your own repo)
- If you would like to build a for-profit/closed-source product out of the code, you are also welcome to do so
- In either case, you will **NOT** be allowed to run the project under the 1Feed name or brand, as this has been transferred to the owner of the "new" 1Feed product. I will specify this in the license. You better start thinking of names!
- All references to the 1Feed name and logo will be removed from the source code and replaced with something generic

As it will take me some time to remove the 1Feed branding from the source code and get it ready for public release, the open-source release will not happen immediately. It might be a few months away depending on how busy I am.

I will update this post once it's been released. If you would like to be notified, please [email me](mailto:1feed@ethan.link).

## That's all!

Thanks for reading, and it's been a pleasure serving you over the years. Hopefully the shutdown doesn't cause you too much inconvenience and you find a new reader that you're happy with!

If you have any questions, just [email](mailto:1feed@ethan.link)!
